Given an integer array representing different denominations of currency and an integer , find the number of ways you can make  by using different combinations from coins[ ].  
Note: Assume that you have an infinite supply of each type of coin. 

sum = 4 ,
N = 3
coins[] = {1,2,3}
4
: Four Possible ways are:
{1,1,1,1},{1,1,2},{2,2},{1,3}.

:
Sum = 10 ,
N = 4
coins[] ={2,5,3,6}
5
: Five Possible ways are:
{2,2,2,2,2}, {2,2,3,3}, {2,2,6}, {2,3,5}
and {5,5}.


You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function which accepts an array coins as input parameters and returns the number of ways to make change for given sum of money. 
O(sum*N)
O(sum)

1 <= sum, N <= 103
